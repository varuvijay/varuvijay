# ‚öôÔ∏è Varun S ‚Äî Full Stack Developer & Mechanical Engineer

I‚Äôm a passionate and driven Full-Stack Web Developer with a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, React.js, and TypeScript. I enjoy building scalable, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that create real-world impact. My recent projects include a full-featured e-commerce platform and a secure todo management app, where I handled both frontend and backend development.

While my core strength lies in the Java tech stack, I'm a quick learner and always ready to adapt to new technologies, frameworks, and tools. I'm deeply interested in clean code, performance optimization, and scalable architecture‚Äîand I thrive in collaborative, agile teams that value continuous learning and innovation.

Currently, I'm looking for opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully, grow alongside a high-performing team, and stay at the forefront of modern web development.
